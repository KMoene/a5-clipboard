# Webware Final Project ---- Moene's Clipboard

## Team members

## General description
We are making an online content-hosting and content-sharing service just like pastebin or any other text storage sites where the users can store plain text or share texts to other people. However the sender will be asked to input a secret key or password for sharing and the receiver has to provide the same secret key or password to view the text content. 

All encryption will be done at the client so that no plaintext would be shown throughout the commication. Only the registered user can send messages, but receiver doesn't have to be a registered user. All information will be store in mongodb and will be hosted on Heroku.
